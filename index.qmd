## Machine Learning Project

**Sum up of the project**

Can we predict the risk of developing a tumor based on an individual’s symptoms? We aim to design a simple artificial intelligence system that determines whether a patient should be concerned given their observed symptoms. Using Python and basic machine learning tools, we will train a supervised classification model on a disease–symptom dataset.

**The data**

We use **Disease-Symptom Dataset**

```{python}

#import kagglehub

# Download latest version
#path = kagglehub.dataset_download("dhivyeshrk/diseases-and-symptoms-dataset")

print("Path to dataset files:")

```

**Pre-processing**

```{python}

```
